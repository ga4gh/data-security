**1. Introduction**

This document describes the security technology infrastructure recommended for
stakeholders (see section 2.4 below) in the *Global Alliance for Genomics and
Health* (GA4GH) community. As a living document, the *Security Technology
Infrastructure* will be revised and updated over time, in response to changes in
the [GA4GH Privacy and Security
Policy](https://www.ga4gh.org/wp-content/uploads/Privacy-and-Security-Policy.pdf)
[1], and as technology and biomedical science continue to advance.

The GA4GH is an unincorporated collaboration among entities and individuals
pursuing the common mission of accelerating progress in medicine and human
health by advancing a common infrastructure of harmonized approaches to enable
effective and responsible processing of clinical and genomic data. Towards that
end, the GA4GH develops standards aiming to enable responsible genomic data
processing within a [human rights
framework](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/framework-for-responsible-sharing-of-genomic-and-health-related-data/).

All of these standards depend upon a safe, robust, and trustworthy technology
infrastructure that, along with a set of common values and expectations set
forth in the [Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related
Data](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/framework-for-responsible-sharing-of-genomic-and-health-related-data/)
[2], provide the foundation for the GA4GH ecosystem. The viability and success
of the envisioned GA4GH ecosystem are directly dependent upon *trust* – the
ability of Alliance stakeholders to trust each other, the ability of users to
trust the technology infrastructures within which the GA4GH standards are
implemented, and the ability of individuals who contribute their personal
clinical and genomic data to trust GA4GH stakeholders to use their data
responsibly and respectfully.

As an interdependent, emergent ecosystem, the GA4GH supports multiple physical
and logical architectures. Therefore, the security technology outlines herein
are not intended to describe a physical or operational implementation, but
rather suggests a set of security and architectural standards, guidelines, and
best practices for implementing and operating a trustworthy, federated
environment within which data and services are shared. Given the important role
that trust plays in pursuing the mission of the GA4GH, the security technology
infrastructure is not limited to those mechanisms traditionally considered
“security” technologies, such as authentication, authorization, access control,
and audit, but also includes architectural guidance for building and operating
trustworthy systems – that is, systems that can be relied upon to perform their
expected functions and to withstand threats to data integrity, information
confidentiality, and service availability.

The *Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data*
describes the principles that form the trust foundation for GA4GH. The *GA4GH
Privacy and Security Policy,* which builds upon this *Framework*, articulates
policies for securing the data and services provided under the auspices of the
GA4GH with the privacy of the individuals who enable their genomic and
health-related data to be discovered, accessed, and used. The *Security
Technology Infrastructure* defines guidelines, best practices, and standards for
building and operating a technology infrastructure that adheres to the GA4GH
*Framework* principles and enforces the GA4GH *Privacy and Security Policy*.

The technology infrastructure defined herein aims to reflect the prevailing
state of practice, while enabling emerging approaches to processing sensitive
information on a massive scale. It is intended to support a broad range of
existing use cases, while allowing innovation. We realize that as the volume and
value of clinical and genomic data continue to increase exponentially, threat
agents will become ever more determined to find and exploit vulnerabilities in
the technology infrastructures that transmit, store, and process this data.

We strongly encourage organizations to adhere to a recognized security
framework, such as ISO/IEC 27001 [3] or the U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology Special Publication 800-53 [4] to accomplish the control and
assurance objectives arising from identified risks concerning data sensitivity
and integrity, and services availability.

**2. Security Foundation**

**2.1 Risk Assessment**

The *GA4GH Security Technology Infrastructure* is based on a balanced approach
to risk management that relies on each individual stakeholder to help protect
the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of the GA4GH ecosystem. Each
stakeholder should assess its individual risk on an on-going basis and ensure
that its own implemented policies, procedures, and technology protections are
appropriate and sufficient for managing the identified risks not only to the
enterprise, but to the GA4GH ecosystem.

To be successful, the GA4GH ecosystem needs to effectively manage the following
risks. [5]

-   Data Breach - *“a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
    destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to,
    personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”* [6].

    -   Breach of confidentiality – unauthorized disclosure of information that
        an individual or organization wishes to keep confidential.

    -   Breach of individual privacy and autonomy – access to and use of an
        individual’s genomic or health-related data without the appropriate
        knowledge or consent of the individual concerned, or for purposes the
        individual has not authorized.

-   Malicious or accidental corruption or destruction of genomic and
    health-related data.

-   Disruption coming from malicious/targeted acts in the availability of data
    and services necessary to maintain appropriate access to clinical and
    genomic data.

-   Unethical, illegal, or inappropriate actions that attempt to breach security
    controls, surreptitiously obtain or derive information in an unauthorized
    manner, or otherwise undermine the trust fabric of the GA4GH.

>   **2.2 Control Objectives**

The *Privacy and Security Policy* specifically builds upon the *Framework’s*
Core Element: “Privacy, Data Protection and Confidentiality”. The *Security
Technology Infrastructure* recommends technical safeguards, standards,
guidelines, and best practices for implementing and operating a technology
infrastructure that will enable individual stakeholders to implement GA4GH
standards safely, and to enforce the *Policy* defined for the GA4GH ecosystem.

Thus, the *Security Technology Infrastructure* is defined to meet the following
five control objectives that respond to the risks identified in the above
sub-section.

-   *Control Objective 1*: Implement technology safeguards to prevent
    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of confidential and private data.

-   *Control Objective 2*: Implement technology safeguards to prevent the
    discovery, access, and use of individuals’ clinical and genomic data, and
    individual identities, other than as authorized by applicable jurisdictional
    law, institutional policy, and individual consents.

-   *Control Objective 3*: Implement technology safeguards to prevent and detect
    accidental or malicious corruption or destruction of data.

-   *Control Objective 4*: Implement technology safeguards to prevent
    disruption, degradation, and interruption of services enabling access to
    data.

-   *Control Objective 5*: Implement technology safeguards to prevent and detect
    potential security attacks and misuse of authorized accesses and privileges.

>   **2.3 Guiding Principles**

The *Security Technology Infrastructure* is consistent with the [Framework for
Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related
Data](https://www.ga4gh.org/ga4ghtoolkit/regulatoryandethics/framework-for-responsible-sharing-genomic-and-health-related-data/),
and seeks to enforce the policy articulated in the [GA4GH Privacy and Security
Policy](https://www.ga4gh.org/docs/ga4ghtoolkit/data-security/Privacy-and-Security-Policy.pdf)*.*

>   **2.4 Information Security Stakeholders**

As a virtual ecosystem, the GA4GH assigns roles and responsibilities for
information security to stakeholders within this ecosystem. From a security and
privacy perspective, the principal stakeholders are:

*Operational Stakeholders*:

1.  *Data Contributors*: the entities who make their data available for
    exploitation to the GA4GH ecosystem. These include:

    1.  Data subjects – people who allow their genomic and health-related data
        to be used and shared;

    2.  Data owners – the legal persons, agencies or bodies to which data
        subjects delegate the authority to decide on the access and usage of
        their data.

2.  *Data Stewards*: the entities to which Data Contributors delegate the
    responsibility of ensuring the integrity and quality of data made available
    to the GA4GH community, and of guaranteeing that data management is
    consistent with GA4GH standards, applicable law, institutional policy, and
    individual permissions.

3.  *Data Users*: the entities who process the data provided by Data
    Contributors according to the business and security policies set by Data
    Stewards, and which put in place all the needed technical safeguards to
    enforce them. These include:

    1.  Infrastructure service providers - entities that provide technology
        resources and technical support for persisting, protecting, managing,
        accessing, transmitting, and using electronic data; they include both
        enterprise and cloud service providers;

    2.  Data service providers – entities that provide data storage, protection,
        management, access, and transmission services to the GA4GH community,
        and optionally ensure that data transmitted or uploaded to other
        destinations are qualified according to the specifications for both data
        and metadata quality, access constraints, and semantics, as appropriate;

    3.  Application service providers – entities that provide application
        services, such as web-based or mobile clients, for manipulating and
        analyzing data using GA4GH standards.

4.  *Data Consumers* – individuals and software clients that use data and
    application services available to the GA4GH community.

*Global Alliance* – a collaborative community of individuals and organizations
that collectively provide foundational policy, technology standards, leadership,
and sustainment to enable the ethical and productive processing and use of
genomic and health-related data.

**Figure 1. Data security roles and their relationships.**

The GA4GH expects that in many cases, one organization may behave in more than
one operational stakeholder role. For example, a data steward may also be a data
service provider; an infrastructure service provider might also offer
application and data services hosted on the infrastructure they support. In such
cases, the organization as a whole is responsible for demonstrating control
effectiveness for the applicable controls. The expectation is that operational
stakeholders should document the roles and responsibilities as appropriate
within that community. Furthermore, such organization should assure that
security-critical functions and responsibilities are delegated among multiple
roles and multiple individuals to help avoid conflicts of interest, prevent
inappropriate activities, provide broader coverage and reduce key person risk.

Figure 2 below is a graphical representation of the delegation of
responsibilities for implementing and operating in accordance with the GA4GH
*Security Technology Infrastructure*.

**Figure 2. Allocation of responsibility for security protections.** Those
functions listed in the vertical block are shared by all operational
stakeholders, albeit in a different way for each actor (e.g data consumers
should notify if any breach occurs, but they are not responsible to act upon it)
. Functions listed in the other blocks are allocated to data stewards, data
users, data consumers, and GA4GH.

Infrastructure service providers may provide a wide range of services to data
and application service providers, including computing, storage, network, and
security services. Most commonly, these services will be virtualized across data
centers and geographic locations. The applicability of, and responsibility for
providing, each of the security functions within the “data user” block will
depend upon the specific services provided, as well as the contractual
agreements established between infrastructure service providers and their
customers.

**3. Security Technology Building Blocks**

This section provides guidance on implementing security services within an
operational stakeholder’s organization and across the GA4GH interconnected
community.

Each stakeholder should perform a comprehensive risk assessment at least
annually and should assess potential risk impacts whenever significant changes
are made to network and system software or hardware.

**3.1 Identity Management**

The effectiveness of the *Security Technology Infrastructure* ultimately is
dependent upon the degree to which the actors (individuals and software
services) are known and can be trusted to conform to applicable policy.

-   Each API exposed by data and application services within the GA4GH community
    will have the capability to electronically authenticate its fully qualified
    domain name using a server certificate or, within the EU, a qualified
    electronic signature, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic
    identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the
    internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [6].

-   Each data user will authenticate the identity of individuals and software
    accessing data and services under that provider’s control.

-   Data users are encouraged to externalize authentication and authorization
    services to trusted identity providers and brokers.

-   The level of assurance to which individual identities will be established
    (i.e., identity proofing) and authenticated will be consistent with the
    level of risk associated with the actions to be performed by that
    individual. Each data user is encouraged to use the US National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63-3 [7] as guidance
    in determining the appropriate level of assurance required for identity
    proofing, authentication, and federation.

-   Data users are encouraged to make use of the *GA4GH Authentication and
    Authorization Infrastructure* (AAI) standard [8] to federate identity
    authentication and service authorization. Data users are also encouraged to
    use GA4GH standards for representing researcher identity attributes in
    OpenID Connect (OIDC) claims [9], and data use ontology (DUO) [10] for
    representing security and privacy attributes of shared data.

**3.2 Authorization and Access Control**

-   Each data user and data consumer will implement access control policies and
    mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users (human user or software
    client) may access data and services authorized and provided through the
    GA4GH community, and that each authenticated user is given access to all and
    only data and services to which it has been authorized.

-   Access authorizations may be based on organization, individual user, role,
    location and context (e.g., purpose, authorization time limits).

-   Each data user and data consumer is responsible for controlling access to
    genomic and health-related data in accordance with applicable law and the
    personal authorizations associated with the data.

-   Each data user and data consumer is responsible for assuring that any
    disclosure of identifiable data include the personal authorization rules the
    recipient must enforce with respect to access to, and use of, those data.

-   Each data user and data consumer with whom genomic or health-related data
    are shared will control access to and use of those data in accordance with
    the personal authorization rules (i.e., consents, permissions) associated
    with the data.

-   Each data steward is responsible for developing and implementing policies
    and procedures for determining whether a requesting data user (human user or
    software client) is granted access to data sets and applications, and for
    authorizing rights and privileges associated with that access, in accordance
    with relevant jurisdictional laws, GA4GH policies, institutional policies,
    and data steward authorizations.

-   Requests for access to data through an API should be communicated in a JSON
    structure, as specified in the *GA4GH Authentication and Authorization
    Infrastructure* (AAI) standard [8], and should include, at a minimum: (1)
    the authenticated identity and attributes of the requester (packaged in
    OpenID Connect tokens, using GA4GH *Researcher Identity* semantics [11]);
    (2) identification of requested resource; and (3) a description of intended
    use, represented in accordance with *GA4GH Data-Use* semantics [10].

-   As a prerequisite to obtaining data access, each data consumer should have
    attested that (1) data will be used only by the authorized requester; and
    (2) any data persisted on a user device will be disposed of in accordance
    with the *Privacy and Security Policy*.

-   Each data user is responsible for assigning to each data consumer the
    minimum access rights and privileges necessary for the requested use,
    consistent with the user’s authenticated identity, attributes, and context.

-   Each data user is responsible for configuring service APIs and service
    platforms so that they allow access consistent with the *Privacy and
    Security Policy* and the *GA4GH AAI Standard*, while blocking inappropriate
    uses and accesses.

-   OpenID Connect tokens issued by trusted identity providers or brokers may be
    used as a basis for authorizing data consumers access rights and privileges.
    For example, a Research Passport issued through the UK National Institute of
    Health Research (NIHR) Research Passport System [12], might be used as the
    basis for authorizing researchers access rights and privileges to passport
    holders.

-   Each data user should provide publicly accessible documentation of its
    policies and procedures for adjudicating requests for access to data and
    services.

>   **3.3 Privacy Protection**

-   Each data steward and data user should use consent-management, access
    control, usage monitoring, auditing mechanisms, and other privacy-protecting
    mechanisms to help ensure that private and sensitive data are collected,
    used, shared, and reused only in accordance with the permissions granted by
    the individual (or authorized representative) to whom the data pertains, and
    in accordance with applicable law and institutional policies. Private and
    sensitive data include both personal data, such as genomic and
    health-related data, and data considered private and confidential by the
    data holder or jurisdictional law, such as, for example, data governed under
    the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [13], under the
    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [14], under
    appendix J of the Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
    Systems and Organizations [15], under the Australian Information
    Commissioner Act (AICA) [16], or any other similar law.

-   Each data steward should ensure that any procedure used to eliminate or
    minimize direct and/or indirect identifiers from data (e.g.,
    pseudonymisation, de-identification, anonymisation) are performed at the
    earliest practical point in the workflow to minimize potential exposure of
    individual identity.

-   Each data steward should maintain a data inventory that includes defined
    sensitivity of data, restrictions on storage and data flows, and contracted
    data services responsible for enforcing these restrictions.

-   Each data steward should monitor data usage to detect attempts to access or
    use data other than as authorized, including attempts to analytically derive
    identity.

-   Each data steward and data user should implement mechanisms to prevent the
    identity of individuals from being leaked through covert means such as
    metadata, URLs, message headers, and inference attacks.

-   Each data steward and data user should implement safeguards to reduce the
    likelihood that de-identified, pseudonymized, or anonymised data can be
    re-identified through the query results or data record linkage (to prevent
    attacks such as Bustamante [17] and Homer [18]). The use of
    privacy-preserving record linkage methods [19] and/or any other methods to
    ensure differential privacy [20] are encouraged.

-   Each data steward is responsible for obtaining the individual authorisations
    (e.g., consents) required by applicable law and institutional policy, and
    for conveying these authorisations, or a link to these authorisations, along
    with the associated data.

-   Each data steward is responsible for updating provenance and confidentiality
    metadata associated with the data under its control, preferably using HL7
    FHIR provenance [21] and confidentiality [22] codes.

**3.4 Audit Logs**

-   Each data user is responsible for recording and maintaining a log of
    security-relevant events involving access to or use of application and data
    services under that provider’s control.

-   For each security-relevant event, the data user should record the following
    data elements: user identity, type of event, date and time, success or
    failure indication, origination of event, name of affected data, system
    component, or resource [23].

-   Each data user should retain the audit log history for at least one year,
    with a minimum of three months immediately available for analysis (for
    example, online, archived, or restorable from backup). This best practice
    should be interpreted within the constraints of applicable law.

-   Each data user is responsible for monitoring activity on systems and
    networks under its control to detect potential security breaches and data
    misuse.

-   Each data user should have a layered approach to instrumentation including,
    but not exclusive to;

    -   Log analysis

    -   Exception handling analysis

    -   Web Application Firewalls/Intrusion Detection Systems

-   Data users’ audit log records should be integratable with existing
    enterprise security monitoring tools.

-   Data stewards and their users are jointly responsible for implementing the
    capability to generate an accounting of accesses to and disclosures of data
    that may be associated with the individual’s identity.

>   **3.5 Data Integrity**

-   Each data user is responsible for protecting the integrity of genomic and
    health-related data that it holds, uses, or transmits.

-   Each data user that transmits or receives transmissions containing genomic
    or health-related data is encouraged to use any collision-resistant hash
    function that complies with the Secure Hash Standard [24] by NIST (e.g.,
    IETF SHA-2 [25]) to verify the integrity of the transmission.

-   Each data steward is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and verifiability
    of data and associated metadata.

-   Each data steward is responsible for assuring that data provenance
    information is associated with data made available to consumers.

>   **3.6 Non-repudiation**

-   Each data user will have the capability to digitally sign content using a
    qualified electronic signature, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of
    the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic
    identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the
    internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [6].

-   Data users who offer downloadable software will digitally sign the
    downloadable files using a qualified electronic signature, as defined in
    Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
    23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic
    transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC [6].

**3.7 Cryptographic Controls**

-   Each data user will ensure that any cryptographic controls used are
    compliant with all applicable standards, agreements, laws, and regulations.

-   Each data user that stores genomic or health-related data will use strong
    encryption (cryptography based on industry-tested and accepted algorithms,
    along with strong key lengths and proper key-management practices) to
    encrypt the data for storage [26].

-   Each data user will ensure that plaintext data encryption keys are stored
    outside the system in which data encrypted with those keys are persisted.
    When a key hierarchy is used, plaintext key encryption keys should be stored
    separately on the system storing data encryption keys.

-   Data users are encouraged to use privacy-preserving encryption methods
    (e.g., homomorphic encryption [27], secure multi-party computation [28])
    when applicable and practical.

>   **3.8 Communications Security**

-   Each data user will ensure that communication channels are secured
    commensurate with the level of risk associated with the content being
    transmitted.

-   Each data user that transmits unencrypted genomic or health-related data
    will protect its transmission (e.g., using IPsec [29, 30] or Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) protocol [31]).

-   Any electronic mail containing genomic, health-related, or other sensitive
    data will be secured (e.g., using S/MIME Version 2 [32, 33]).

>   **4. Operational Assurances**

>   **4.1 Physical and Environmental Security**

-   A data user that stores or processes genomic or health-related data is
    responsible for providing physical and environmental safeguards to protect
    those data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, institutional
    policies, and individual consents.

-   Each data user who uses a third party to store or process genomic or
    health-related data is responsible for assuring that business agreements
    include an obligation to provide physical and environmental data protection.

**4.2 Service Assurances**

All data users are responsible for implementing appropriate defense-in-depth
architectural assurances that will enable them to provide a high level of
service expectations, including:

-   *Availability* – the service should be able to perform its functions over a
    specified period of time, generally expressed as the proportion of time that
    a service is actually available within an agreed-upon time period.
    Availability is ensured through architectural and design features, and
    operational procedures that enhance reliability, maintainability,
    serviceability, resiliency, and security safeguards.

-   *Scalability (or elasticity)* – genomic and health-related data stores
    should be capable of expanding as the volume of data continues to grow,
    while protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its
    services.

-   *Infrastructure security* – security features and processes provided as part
    of a service should ensure that their networks, operating systems,
    applications, and database management systems isolate software processes and
    datasets to prevent interference and side-channel attacks. A “least
    privileges” approach should be used to harden execution environments.

-   *Code security* - software providers should make a best effort to ensure
    that their software is free of malicious code and that secrets are never in
    the code. Code should be checked for downstream library vulnerability
    (“supply chain attack”). Code should have an approval process before
    promotion (“protected branches”) and should be signed.

-   *Data durability* – all genomic and health-related data, critical data or
    data deemed vulnerable should be copied to a secure accessible secondary
    location and preserved in case the original data are corrupted, deleted,
    lost, or altered in any way. Backups can be ensured through regular copying
    of full databases and incremental data backup jobs of modified or newly
    created data.

-   *Disaster recovery* – the ability to restore the availability and
    accessibility of genomic and health-related data or data deemed critical in
    a timely manner should, for example, a natural disaster or security breach
    occur.

-   *Data retention* – the period of time that data should be retained is
    contingent on applicable jurisdictional law and institutional policy.
    Archived data should be retained for no longer than is necessary before
    being deleted to minimize the risk of a breach of data.

-   *Data destruction* – ensure that all information that has reached its
    end-of-life (as applicable under jurisdictional law) is destroyed safely and
    permanently to minimize storage and an organization’s risk to a breach of
    data.

>   **4.3 Information Security Oversight and Accountability**

-   Each data steward will document the privacy and security practices and
    procedures it uses to make its data and services available within the GA4GH
    community, consistent with the *GA4GH Privacy and Security Policy*, and will
    ensure that its data users make this documentation conveniently available to
    data consumers and to individuals who contribute their data.

-   At the request of an individual whose data are being stored and shared
    within the GA4GH community, the responsible data steward should provide the
    individual information about how and by whom their data are being accessed
    and used and for what purposes.

-   Each data steward will document the behavioral standards associated with the
    use of data and services made available to data consumers, consistent with
    GA4GH *Privacy and Security Policy*, and will require data users to attest
    to their understanding of, and commitment to adhere to these standards.

-   Data stewards should provide traceability and proof of conduct for all data
    destroyed, particularly when outsourcing this effort to third parties.

-   Each data user will document and enforce written operational procedures for
    protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data, the availability of
    services, and the privacy of individuals who contribute their personal data.

-   Each data user is strongly encouraged to engage an independent third party
    to conduct penetration testing of, but not exclusively, its service
    infrastructure at least annually. Any necessary remediation activities
    should be conducted as quickly as possible, and subjected to both functional
    and assurance testing.

-   Each data user will have documented procedures for monitoring system
    activities, detecting potential threats and vulnerabilities (vulnerability
    reporting), and notifying potential security incidents (breach
    notification).

-   Each data user, in collaboration with the corresponding data steward, will
    investigate and resolve security incidents, breaches, and reported threats
    as quickly as possible so as to minimize potential damage to individuals,
    data loss, disruption of data and application services.

-   Each operational stakeholder will report any breaches in a way consistent
    with the *GA4GH Breach Response Strategy* [34]. Data stewards, in
    collaboration with the other operational stakeholders, will also respond to
    these breaches. In particular:

    -   Each operational stakeholder will report to applicable regulatory
        authorities or identified responsible actors any breaches resulting in
        the potential disclosure of genomic or health-related data

    -   Each operational stakeholder will report to GA4GH any breaches
        associated with the use of GA4GH standards and breaches that could
        damage the reputation and trustworthiness of the GA4GH community.

    -   Each data user who experiences or suspects a data breach involving the
        disclosure of potentially identifiable data is responsible for
        expeditiously reporting the breach to the data steward responsible for
        the breached data.

    -   Each data consumer who experiences or suspects a data breach involving
        the disclosure of potentially identifiable data is responsible for
        expeditiously reporting the breach to the relevant institutional
        supervisory authority and to the data steward.

    -   Each data steward who experiences, suspects, or receives a report of a
        data breach involving the disclosure of potentially identifiable data is
        responsible for expeditiously reporting the breach to the individuals
        whose data were breached.

    -   Each data steward should work with its data users to assess risks
        associated with the storage, use, and transmission of genomic and
        health-related data, and should contractually require appropriate
        technical mechanisms and procedures for preventing, detecting, and
        recovering from data breaches, consistent with the assessed risks.

-   Each GA4GH team that proposes a standard work product will complete an
    initial security risk-assessment at the start of product development.
    Prerequisite to approval as a GA4GH standard, the product will undergo a
    security evaluation that will include a final security risk assessment
    review and assurance testing, as appropriate.

**4.4 Regulatory and Policy Compliance**

-   Each data user is responsible for assuring that data are transmitted,
    persisted, and protected in compliance with all applicable legal and ethical
    requirements.

-   Each operational stakeholder is individually responsible for implementing
    protections consistent with this infrastructure, and for assuring that
    contracts with third parties address the business partners’ obligations to
    implement such protections.

-   Each operational stakeholder will implement appropriate security procedures
    to ensure compliance with applicable legislative, regulatory, and
    contractual requirements relating to the use of genomic or health-related
    data, and personal information.

-   Each operational stakeholder will implement appropriate security procedures
    to ensure compliance with applicable legislative, regulatory, and
    contractual requirements relating to intellectual property rights.

-   Each operational stakeholder is responsible for implementing, and attesting
    to having implemented, security and privacy processes, procedures, and
    technology to enforce compliance with relevant legislation, regulations,
    contractual clauses, and the *GA4GH Privacy and Security Policy.*

-   Operational stakeholders may individually or collectively engage third
    parties to assess compliance with the GA4GH *Security Technology
    Infrastructure*, and to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented
    protections.

**5. Conclusion**

This document provides a series of guidelines in an attempt to ensure that all
products/standards coming out of GA4GH uphold the basic security best practices
by operating a safe, robust, and trustworthy technology infrastructure.
Revisions of this document will take place every two years except if imperative
changes have to be made in the meantime (e.g. new technologies that have to be
contemplated). For those wishing to provide some feedback please contact us by
email at: <security-leads@ga4gh.org>.

**5.1. Next version inclusions**

The next revision of the “Security Technology Infrastructure” will include
sections on developer code security such as secrets’ management, dependency
analysis and static code analysis. It will also include a support document with
guidance and language on runtime protections for running application code.
